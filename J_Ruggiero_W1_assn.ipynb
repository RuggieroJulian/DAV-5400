    "For week 1 assignemnt, I will use the breast-cancer-wisconsin data. I am interested in this dataset because it provides valuable information related to the breast cancer cell, such as its size, shape, and class. Despite there are some missing values, there are only 16 instances, denoted by \"?\", it also contains a good amount of records (699). My goal is to be able to answer these questions:\n",

    "- Percentage of the cases that are benign and malign?\n",
    "- For the malign cases, which is the cell behaviour in terms of its shape and size?\n",
    "- What about the benign ones? which is their behaviour?\n",
    "- Which are the main characteristics that differenciate a benign from a malign tumor?\n",
